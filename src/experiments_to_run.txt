Hyperparameter Testing:
    Path length k - 10 25 50 75 100
    Delegation Threshold d w * 9/10, w, w * 3/2, w * 2, w * 3,  w * 5, w * 10
    Rejection Threshold r
        - Would like to show this for varying path lengths k 
        - With r threshold test need to make sure problem is big enough to show improvement of 
          sampling versus no sampling. If number of nodes used isn't large then delegation threshold
          will be small and thus sampling won't be as effective.
        - RMAT of v = 26, e = 1 Billion, showed improvment of when using r = 2 instead of r = 1, for varying k's.
    When discussing reasoning for rejection threshold method, I think it would be a good idea to do it and compare it with the old
    way of rejection sampling which was based purely on the degree of the vertex rather than considering path length and degree of
    the vertex to estimate the number of samplings needed. Doing it this way allows for the r hyperparameter to be less relevant than them
    original portion.
